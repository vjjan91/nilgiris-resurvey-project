# Exploratory analysis of occurrence data

This script carries out exploratory analysis of historical and modern occurrence data from the Nilgiri hills.

## Load the historical occurrence data and explore patterns

The historical occurrence data is a combination of data from museum specimens and those observations made in published literature/journals (titled journal data). We apply the following key filters on this dataset prior to carrying out further exploratory analyses: a) we subset historical data to only include specimen information until the year 1950 and b) we excluded historical sampling locations that had very few records (total specimen data < 10).
```{r}
hist_occ <- read.csv("data/historical-occurrence-data.csv")

# after exploring the data, we will apply the following filters on the dataset

# a: include only data until 1950
hist_occ <- hist_occ %>%
  filter(year <= 1950)

# b: a second filter includes only those species that had a minimum count of atleast three specimens and occurred across atleast two unique historical survey locations

# total species count across historical data
spp_count <- hist_occ %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, common_name) %>%
  count() # total of 179 species

sppMinThree <- spp_count %>%
  filter(n >= 3) # total of 92 species
# please note, we include ~four species that were collected from a single historical location Apus melba, Apus melba, Brachypodius priocephalus, Phylloscopus tytleri, Picus chlorolophus

# filter historical data
hist_occ <- hist_occ %>%
  filter(scientific_name %in% sppMinThree$scientific_name)

# count of data by year
occ_year <- hist_occ %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count()

# The above count suggests that majority of the bird specimens were recorded in 1881, followed by some data from 1876.

collector <- hist_occ %>%
  group_by(collectedBy) %>%
  count()

# 37 unique collectors/ornithologists who collected museum specimens in this time period, with the maximum number of records by William Davison, followed by R G Wardlaw-Ramsay. 
```

## Examining historical data by locality
```{r}
# Twenty unique historical site localities across which species were recorded
occ_locality <- hist_occ %>%
  group_by(historical_site_code) %>%
  count()

## OTCM had the highest number of specimens (~674) while RNMD had the lowest (1 specimen)

# Examining species by locality
spp_loc <- hist_occ %>%
  group_by(common_name, historical_site_code) %>%
  count()

# how many unique sites
prop_count <- spp_loc %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarise(uniqueSites = length(unique(historical_site_code)))
```
