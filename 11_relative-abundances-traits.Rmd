# Examining changes in relative abundance over time as a function of species habitat affiliation  

In this script, we will examine how relative abundance varies as a function of habitat affiliation across time periods for bird communities. We will plot species rank abundances of relative abundance to estimate how values of relative abundance has shifted for each species. In addition, we will run beta regressions to test for significance in relative abundance changes over time.

# note: the classification of habitat type was created by comparing habitat affiliation data from the State of India's Birds report (v2; released in 2023). 
# this classification was also vetted independently by two reviewers.
# We used the following trait classifications:
# Forest 
# Grassland 
# Generalist

# Our criteria for each of these classifications includes the following: 
# In the 1850s, the land cover change analysis revealed that the majority of the landscape was largely grasslands and forests. However in 2018, the landscape is largely a mosaic of human-modified land cover types - including wooded habitats (mostly comprising timber plantations and degraded forests), tea plantations, followed by forests and grasslands.
# While the State of India's Birds provides a habitat classification/criteria based on contemporary use of habitats by a species, we classified species based on our resurveys and assuming that a species would either be in a forest affiliated bird species, grassland species or a generalist species in the 1850s. 
# An example in this case is the black and orange flycatcher. While it is commonly found in shola forest habitat, this species is also common in degraded wooded areas, including timber plantations today. However, historically, in the 1850s (due to limited presence of timber plantations compared to 2018), we assume that this is a forest specialist bird as no other wooded habitats apart from forests existed (predominantly) in the 1850s (See 06_land-cover-classification.Rmd)
# Other examples include bird species that prefer open habitats, scrubland and dry grassland - such species have been lumped into the Grassland category as this was the closest habitat similar to the above habitat types in 1850s. Eg. Blue-tailed bee-eater, long-tailed shrike, black-winged kite. 
# If a species is truly a generalist species and is not particularly occupying/specialized on any particular  forested/wooded/grassland habitat, it was classified in the generalist category

## Visualizing relative abundance change by species across time periods for grassland bird species 

Based on the above statistical analyses, we found that the mean relative abundance of grassland bird species were significantly lower in 2021 compared to the previous two historical time periods. Here, we assess how relative abundance varies by species between the historical and modern time period.
