# Estimating species persistence probabilities

In this script, we will estimate probabilities of persistence for each species over time by accounting for sampling method across different years (eg. specimen collected vs. observation for historical data and heard vs. seen for modern occurrence data)

```{r}
## Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scico)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(data.table)

# source custom functions
source("code/03_persistence-probability-functions.R")
```

### Load in historical occurrence data
```{r}
## read in historical occurrence data
hist_occ <- read.csv("results/histSubset.csv")

# We add in two columns to the above dataframe:

# pci_lower and pci_upper

# here pci is a metric from Thompson et al. 2017 which essentially translates to the probability that the taxon is correctly identified as extant. 
# We make a distinction between the upper and lower probabilities that are assigned to the above metric. 

# We follow Lees et al. (2021) and Thompson et al. (2017) who assigned values of 0.95-0.99 for specimen based records/museum records and conservative values of 0.5-0.65 for journal data (often reporting observations/sightings and not specimens collected). Such probabilities are assigned to account for varying efforts that cannot be quantified from historical observations. 

hist_occ <-  hist_occ %>%
  mutate("pci_lower" = 
           case_when(institutionCode == "JournalData" ~ 0.5,
                                 TRUE ~ 0.95)) %>%
  mutate("pci_upper" = 
           case_when(institutionCode == "JournalData" ~ 0.65, TRUE ~ 0.99))

### fix the count column
hist_occ <-  hist_occ %>%
  mutate(histCount = case_when(individualCount == "X" ~ 1,
                               individualCount == "" ~ 1,
                               TRUE ~ as.numeric(individualCount)))
```

## Load in modern occurrence data
```{r}
## read in modern occurrence data
mod_occ <- read.csv("results/modSubset.csv")

## add the pci_lower and pci_upper values
## here, we do not make a distinction between heard, seen and flyover observations and assign a pci_lower of 0.95 and a pci_upper of 0.99

mod_occ <- mod_occ %>%
  mutate("pci_lower" =  0.95) %>%
  mutate("pci_upper" = 0.99)
```

## Combine modern and historical occurrence data

Choose the columns necessary for further calculations of probabilities of persistence
```{r}
## historical data
hist_probDat <-  hist_occ %>%
  dplyr::select(scientific_name, year, historical_site_code, pci_lower,pci_upper, histCount) %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, year, historical_site_code) %>%
  mutate(histCount = sum(histCount)) %>%
  rename(., abundance = "histCount") %>%
  distinct(.) %>%
  ungroup()

## modern data
mod_probDat <- mod_occ %>%
  mutate(year = 2021) %>% # change year to 2021 for ease of modeling
  rename(., abundance = "number") %>%
  dplyr::select(scientific_name, year, historical_site_code, pci_lower, pci_upper, abundance) %>%
  group_by(scientific_name, year, historical_site_code) %>%
  mutate(abundance = sum(abundance)) %>%
  distinct(.) %>%
  filter(!is.na(scientific_name)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Calculate probabilities of persistence

We use functions from Thompson et al. 2017 to calculate the same. 

The analysis needs to be done at the site level and at the landscape level
```{r}
# join the above two datasets for ease of calculation
probDat <- full_join(hist_probDat, mod_probDat)

# note: unlike example datasets, we have data for the same year from different locations for the same species. 

## modeling data by species at the site level

# years in which a species was not detected at all, we insert default probabilities for eps, pi and pr - where eps is the the proportion of the taxon's habitat within its likely entire range that was surveyed (0 ≤ ε ≤ 1).
# p(i) = the probability that the taxon, or recent evidence of it, could have been reliably identified in the survey if it had been recorded.
# p(r) = the probability that the taxon, or recent evidence of it, would have been recorded in the survey.

eps.passive = c(0.10,	0.95)
pi.passive = c(0.10,	0.95)
pr.passive = c(0.10,	0.95)
pas.sur = c(eps.passive ,pi.passive,pr.passive)

  ungroup()

  mutate(year = 2021) %>% # change year to 2021 for ease of modeling
