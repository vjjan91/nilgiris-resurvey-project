# Grassland contractions & forest expansions

In the previous script, we inferred that grasslands have contracted dramatically, plantations have increased drastically and forests have expanded as well. In this script, we will compare and contrasts areas where forests and plantations have increased over time and if these areas overlap with grassland habitats (in the past).

In the above visualizations, we observed that forests have expanded across areas that were formerly grasslands. We ask if these expansions vary as a function of elevation. In other words, are forests expanding upslope?
